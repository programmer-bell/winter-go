# ❄️ Frostbyte Go  
Learn Go by doing — mistakes included.

## 📌 About This Project
This repository is a personal journey of learning the **Go programming language and it's one of popular framework called gin** through **real, raw, unpolished practice**.

Instead of hiding errors or rewriting history, I’m embracing a “freeze the moment” mindset:
every mistake, wrong attempt, messy idea, and fix stays here.  
Learning happens through doing — and through breaking things along the way.

No polish. No filters. Just honest progress.

## ❄️ Why “Frostbyte Go”?
The name comes from a mix of:
- **cold & winter themes** (frost, ice, snow)  
- **computing** (“byte”)  
- **the idea that learning can feel like jumping into cold water**  
But once you warm up, it becomes fun.

## 🧊 Learning Approach
- Build **mini-projects**  
- Solve **simple problems**  
- Keep everything **transparent and real**  
- Show **wrong paths**, not just final solutions  
- Improve step by step

## 📂 What You'll Find Here
- Small Go programs  
- Crud API in Gin
- Experiments and playground code  
- Incorrect attempts (kept for learning)  
- Notes and reflections  
- Fixes and rewrites

## 🚀 Goal
Not to be perfect — but to learn Go deeply by doing, breaking, and understanding.

## 🤝 Contributions
This is a personal learning repo, but suggestions or discussions are welcome.

## 🧣 Stay Warm & Keep Coding
Mistakes are part of the journey.  
Let’s keep moving forward, one frostbyte at a time.
